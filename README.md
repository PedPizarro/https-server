# Minimal HTTPS Server in C

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a **minimal HTTP/1.1 and HTTPS server written in C**, built entirely from scratch with the goal of achieving **full RFC compliance** and **complete protocol correctness**.

It is designed to evolve incrementally, from a minimal HTTP parser to a fully functional and standards-compliant HTTPS server, while keeping the implementation clear, modular, and deeply educational. Every component — from request parsing to response generation — is implemented manually, following the relevant RFCs as closely as possible.

## Objectives

- Implement a **fully RFC-compliant** HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 server.
- Achieve **complete HTTPS support** with proper TLS integration.
- Ensure **correct connection management**, persistent connections, and timeout behavior.
- Provide **accurate protocol validation**, error reporting, and standards-based responses.
- Maintain a **clean, minimal, and modular C codebase** suitable for learning or extending.

## Roadmap

This project follows a **custom roadmap**, created by me, that outlines each development phase from the ground up — starting from raw HTTP parsing and moving towards a complete HTTPS server.

The roadmap may not be the most optimal or “official” way to build such a server, but it’s an intentional learning path that others can also follow if they want to understand the process of building a compliant server from scratch.
